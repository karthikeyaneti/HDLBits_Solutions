## 📌 About HDLBits

[HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/) is an interactive platform developed by Henry Wong at University of Toronto to help students and engineers master **Verilog HDL** through progressively challenging problems. It focuses on:

- ✅ Syntax and simulation basics
- ✅ Combinational and sequential logic design
- ✅ Finite State Machines (Mealy & Moore)
- ✅ Common design patterns like shift registers and counters
- ✅ Debugging and waveform analysis

All problems encourage correct **synthesizable Verilog** practices.

Special thanks to my friend **[andbhavyaa](https://github.com/andbhavyaa)** for creating **[⚡︎ skeldir](https://www.npmjs.com/package/skeldir)** — a command-line tool that automatically generates folder skeletons (directory + file structures) based on text templates.

By combining **ChatGPT** to generate the structured folder layout and **skeldir** to create it instantly on my file system, I was able to set up all problem folders and files without any manual effort.

⚡ The entire process was **hassle-free** and saved lots of repetitive work!

> If you're working on projects that require bulk folder or file setup, I highly recommend checking it out.
